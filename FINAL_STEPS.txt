CRITICAL FIX APPLIED - react-router.config.js
===============================================

The missing piece was: react-router.config.js

Files Modified:
1. vite.config.js - Updated to use reactRouter() from @react-router/dev/vite
2. react-router.config.js - CREATED with hydrogenPreset()

Now try building:
  cd ~/Desktop/gueth-ecommerce
  npm run build

If build succeeds:
  npx shopify hydrogen deploy --force

The project should now build successfully!
